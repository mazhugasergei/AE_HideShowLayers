TODO:
1. Check what if:
1.1. No effects, many layers selected
1.2. Some effects, many layers selected
2. Fix UI for the 2nd version

What this script does:
1. You select a Control layer
2. Run the script
3. Select layers you want to control opacity of
4. Click OK
In selected Control layer's effects panel (F3) you'll see a checkbox which allows you to quickly show and hide the layers you selected.
These layers' opacity expression is set to the checkbox value (shown the layer if checked and hidden if unchecked).
